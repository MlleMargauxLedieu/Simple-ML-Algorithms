      "see a guy in a bubble in space with a tree in it eats part of the tree and breaks out of the bubble - wait that happened at the end the guy has a dying wife who is infinitely stoic about dying who writes a book called the fountain that the guy starts reading she wants him to finish the book for her as she has written all but the last chapter this is supposed to be really meaningful because she's dying you know in it a conquistador is sent by the queen of spain to find a hidden mayan pyramid that has the tree of immortality in it using three holes in a broken knife for a map she wants him to do this to save her from the spanish inquisition which nobody expects once there he fights his way through a few warriors and some kind of religious looking person eats some of that tree but instead of it saving him it kills him and turns him into a bunch of flowers within a minute or so what else the guy is some type of medical researcher who violates all the rules about drug studies and in a flash of insight caused by looking at patterns in falling snow i think miraculously comes up with a serum that reverses aging he wanted to use it on his dying wife but she had already died [heavy sigh] he did save a dying monkey though so that's good then back in space he breaks out of the bubble then goes back in i think that's about it he never finishes the book - they kind of forgot about it i guess to those who compare this to 2001 a space odyssey - yes there is a bubble in space in both movies otherwise they bear no resemblance to each other whatsoever to compare this to anything kubrick made is an insult to kubrick if you are the kind of person that thinks it is philosophically deep to see a bald guy in the lotus position tumbling through space or floating four feet off the ground in front a vaguely mayan religious person then you might have a chance of enjoying this movie otherwise be prepared to feel like you just wasted 92 minutes of your life just awful\n",

      "is a terrific movie i found it totally captivating as did my twelve year old son the title has a double meaning it refers to the month of march when the mating cycle of the emperor penguins begins and also to the long march this particular colony has to make to their mating ground why do they have to travel such a distance to their colony well first you have to understand that this movie is about one colony there are dozens of them all around the coat of antarctica i did some reading after the movie the cycle of mating nurturing the egg and raising the chick takes months and months it begins in their fall our spring through their winter spring and into their summer during the spring and summer the ice melts towards their breeding ground they have to be at a place that remains safe for their chicks and in the summer the sea is only a few hundred yards from their breeding ground which is convenient for the feeding of the always hungry and rapidly growing chick the story of the way the couples choose each other create and care for the fertilized egg and that it requires both the male and female penguin and demands on them almost to the point of death is just amazing and strangely inspiring i guess because raising our young for more than twenty years requires a similar kind of dedication but not as concentrated as the penguin couple's absolute focus over one brief season the dcd also has a full length program on the making of the movie this is as fascinating as the movie in its own way the french filmmakers provide their own narration and at times their prose gets a bit much about how much they are sacrificing and so one while i take my hat off to them for giving a year in such awful conditions to get the footage they did choose to do it but this documentary on the making of the film provides extra footage of the penguins that couldn't be in the g-rated version of the film and we get to see what they had to go through to get some of the amazing shots we see in the film there is also a short program from national geographic on the emperor penguins that is pretty good it is terribly marred by its childish quick cutting to add fake excitement of those with attention deficit disorder and its constant harping about how global warming might impact the penguins and that we should all be up in arms about it as if the penguins haven't adapted to changes in climate over the past millions of years give me a break and finally there is the delightful cartoon about bugs bunny trying to take an ice-show penguin who gets separated from his troupe back to the south pole this is a must have dvd and i recommend that everyone watch it and discuss it with their family and friends just great\n",

      "hebrew with english subtitles synopsis the '95 israeli film `devarim' meaning memory of things is the first of three by writerdirectoractor amos gita followed by `yom yom' '98 and `kadosh' '99 which comprise his city trilogy the story unfolds in contemporary tel aviv focusing on three disillusioned thirty-something friends cesar played by assi dayan son of the legendary moshe dayan a moderately successful photographer and woman chaser israel amos schub an underachieving pianist and goldman amos gita your everyday mama's boy when goldman's father dies the three men wake up to the reality that life is temporary and death eventually awaits us all soon there life paths are laid bare in this onslaught of newly obtained self-awareness and how they have been spending their time and energy come into question will they discover their path to fulfillment and meaning or are they doomed to continue just going through the motions critique on the back cover of the dvd case this film is described as a moody portrait of israel's `lost generation' and indeed it is just that there is a pervading feeling of oppression and futility here that is immediately discernible from the very first moment and continues unmercifully to the end the story unfolds slowly beginning one hot sweltering summer's day in tel aviv where three men appear to live in a state of constant uncertainty agitation and depression every word spoken every action performed seems to be an automatic unconscious response that is unconnected to personal thought or human emotion they're just going through the motions of living while never partaking working without experiencing a call to vocation conversing without relating and having sex without loving theirs is a life of smoke and mirrors as goldman suggests in one pertinent conversation the unconscious embracing of the little death in preparation for the big death to follow what i personally found intriguing was the first hand insight the film provided into the mindset of the non-religious jew living in a land trapped in a constant state of emergency what must it be like to live in a land surrounded by militant enemies who want to destroy you a place where military service is mandatory and death at the hands of a suicide bomber can happen at anytime while the religious residents of israel may be able to deal with the situation by a worldview that envisions it to be all a part of god's ultimate plan what about those without religious faith to cling to surely it must be akin to living in a pressure cooker and that concept of impending doom and futility exudes from this film a fascinating subtext to the storyline was a rather long philosophical discussion between goldman and his mother in the second half of the film the conversation dealt with belief in god and atheism suffering and death and finally personal freedom and the right to choose what one does with life goldman comes to the conclusion that committing suicide is the ultimate act one can perform to demonstrate that the individual can do with their life what they will i found this to be a most revealing conclusion to come to by a non-religious israeli who has spent his entire life in the shadow of arabs making just that choice for me that conversation provided an amazing glimpse into the psyche of the contemporary israeli that made the film worth the time and effort\n",

      "its relatively short length and somewhat minimalistic setting hard candy is a film that contains more depth and complexity than i could ever touch on all of in this review the story centers around two main characters a young girl named haley ellen page who meets an older man on the internet patrick wilson not to be confused with the drummer from weezer whom she suspects to be a sexual predator at first it appears that she is falling for his act and taking the bait and as they go back to his house it is apparent to the viewer that bad things are on the horizon this is true but not at all in the way that you'd expect haley soon reveals herself to be an extremely angry and vengeful person who was plotting all along to take her deep-seated rage out on this guy i won't go into the specifics but things get quite unpleasant for this fellow what ensues is a very interesting and horrific ballet between the two in which you see a dizzying array of different emotional layers in both characters one of the most brilliant things about this movie is that there is really no designated hero or villian here and it's almost like your sympathy is meant to shift from one character to the other jeff the male character is indeed revealed to be a pretty bad person but we also see numerous moments in which he appears sympathetic and you almost feel sorry for him even knowing what kind of person he really is likewise haley while an obviously intelligent person with largely good intentions is so driven by her vengeance and rage that she frequently comes off as frighteningly psychotic the lines of good and evil are so heavily blurred between them at times that there almost seems to be no protagonist at all one of the biggest themes obviously is the irrational justification of depravity haley talks about being disgusted by the ways in which pedophiles attempt to justify their actions but ironically she is doing the same thing herself in her own twisted way she feels that she is doing what has to be done even though her actions are just as horrific we see these two characters that are both sick and twisted albeit in very different ways and neither can see their own hypocrisy even if they can recognize it in each other there is so much more that can be discussed here but i think i'll leave it at that now it is time to once again praise the incredible ellen page many know her as the lovable title character in juno but here she proves her amazing versatility with a nearly polar opposite type of performance her performance is dark venomous and downright bone-chilling and even with her small and unimposing stature creates a truly terrifying character but again she's not a complete monster and ellen does an incredible job of bringing many different levels to the character likewise wilson does the same for jeff in the sense that he is never completely a villian or a victim there is so much complexity to both characters and both actors do an amazing job of bringing all those different facets together in their respective roles the cinematography is awesome as well david slade who more recently did 30 days of night is characteristic for using this sort of jerky camera effect to give the sequences a sort of nightmarish surrealism the whole thing almost feels like a frightening dream and entirely taking place between two characters in a small setting it is all the more nightmarish this is definitely not an easy film to watch nor is it recommended to the faint of heart but it is a brilliant examination of the dark side of human nature whether you love it hate it it will definitely stay with you long after it's over\n",

      "director and writer francois ozon has created a moody and compelling film in &quotswimming pool&quot charlotte rampling stars as sarah morton a prim and conventional english mystery writer who goes to the south of france in search of inspiration there she encounters the other two main characters an old swimming pool and her publisher's sensuous french daughter julie ludivine sagnier sarah's pastoral serenity is soon disrupted as she becomes involved in the girl's unconventional and mysterious life i loved this movie it has a leisurely pace and there is little in the way of action and yet i found it mesmerizing the hypnotic intimacy we experience as we watch sarah write her new book is utterly compelling there is an vague feeling of unease and fear from the moment sarah arrives in france while all is outwardly calm and controlled events gradually build to a thrilling climax and beyond that an ending that makes the viewer reevaluate the entire movie the excellent musical score matches the enigmatic mood of the film charlotte rampling is perfect as the proper and cranky old maid who lets her hair down in a big way once she is under the spell of the luscious provence countryside ludivine sagnier seen recently as the delightful tinkerbell in peter pan is well-cast as the in-your-face amoral young stranger who changes sarah's life i think this is mainly a chick-flick although there is ample nudity to keep the guys watching too if you like quiet atmospheric movies that make you experience the characters' emotions and really think about what you've seen you'll enjoy &quotswimming pool&quot\n",

      "the heat of the night won the oscar for best picture of 1967 i was a freshman in college that year and all the talk was about bonnie and clyde a great film the graduate was doing the art-house circuit and wasn't widely seen at the time guess who's coming to dinner was at the time considered ostentatious a rich black man marrying the daughter of a rich white couplehow shocking the fifth nominee that year was rex harrison's doctor dolittle but i don't want to talk about that i find that 25 years later i pull out in the heat of the night to get my kicks from brilliant film-making as well as good suspense and fine acting and direction this was norman jewison's first nomination for direction and not his last some say he lost it to mike nichols for the graduate because nichols probably should've won for his debut film effort virginia woolfmaybe some say rod steiger won his acting oscar because he lost in '65 for the pawnbroker i doubt it in my humble opinion this was steiger's penultimate role a man who is so sure of himself yet is taken down a peg by someone better he will never show his insecurity though you know it's there i also believe after watching this often that steiger's gillespie is not racist merely dealing with a racist environment it's mentioned that he's the new sheriff but it never says where he came from this is good because steiger starts from scratch builds a compelling character shows a bit of lack-of-control and it makes him nervous an wonderfully vulnerable his mind is usually open virgil teaches him hence whatever happens later can only be for his benefit great characters poitier was in 3 good films in 1967 this one guess who's coming to dinner to sir with love i'm sure that when nomination time came his votes were divided for this reason alone i think he would've won the performances of lee grant quentin dean and scott wilson he was in in cold blood that year were stellar the great old gospel singer jester hairston also had a small role he dubbed the singing for poitier's oscar winning role in lilies of the field amen interesting stuff sterling silliphant's screenplay won the oscar hands-down a riveting narrative of a complicated book the greatest thing about steiger's performance is that you know nothing about him or his background when the film begins or even when it's over what you know is that he's stuck in a place he doesn't like and no one likes him there are suggested gay overtones especially when he's in his home and he and virgil talk about loneliness it's quite profound when he doesn't get the answer he wants there's also the great beah richards in a small cameo as mama kaleba a sweet but nonetheless reprehensible character she was nominated that year for guess who's coming to dinner as poitier's wonderfully heart-broken mother a fine performance yes 1967 was a great year the graduate broke a few barriers guess who's coming to dinner broke some and certainly bonnie & clyde made bad guys look good don't forget richard brooks' in cold blooda great year but i still think in the heat of the night is the film i prefer to watch\n",

      "film by patty jenkinsroger ebert listed monster as the best film of all of 2003 charlize theron won the academy award for best actress for her portrayal of serial killer aileen wuornos for months before the oscars the talk had been about how amazing theron's performance was and how not only was it the best performance of the year it was one of the best performances in years this is a lot of high praise that raised my expectations on exactly what it was that i was going to see in monstermonster is based on the true story of aileen wuornos aileen lived as a prostitute in florida and became a serial murderer killing her prospective clients as the film opens aileen is sitting under an overpass and is reflecting back on past events specifically her meeting of selby christina ricci after meeting selby in a bar selby quickly becomes aileen's best and only friend and also her lover they are both very lonely and needy people for the love of selby aileen wants to clean up her life quit hooking and find a real job so she can support selby unfortunately for aileen she is unable to find a job because she has no work experience no resume and a huge chip on her shoulder that prevents anyone in a position to help to even want to help her selby is demanding telling aileen that she needs to start hooking again because they don't have any money she is hungry and this is one thing that aileen can do to support her when she is raped by one of her clients aileen finally snaps and kills him she tells selby that this was a one time thing but after this first murder she starts killing and robbing her other clients it is at this point where we start to see aileen crack under the pressure of what her life has become she feels that from day one she never stood a chance she was sexually abused as a child and by age 13 was pregnant and a prostitute this is her life and she has no opportunity to improve her life her experience trying to find a legitimate job is proof of this monster is the story of aileen wuornos and it is brutal and unflinching it is impossible to separate the performance of charlize theron from the rest of the movie monster is built on the raw power and pain of theron's transformation into aileen wuornos this transformation was both physical and emotional charlize theron is a strikingly beautiful woman and early in her career the roles she became known for were little more than the beautiful wifegirlfriendwoman legend of bagger vance the devil's advocate the cider house rules monster required a physical change in the appearance of theron's face and the make-up helped change the beautiful theron into the ugly wuornos the other part of the transformation is that wuornos was a tormented pained and angry woman and this required theron to not simply be a woman acting but rather to become aileen wuornos she succeeds during the first half of the movie i could not figure out why theron had won the academy award for best actress she had become aileen but the performance was nothing terribly impressive for the first fifty minutes but when selby confronts aileen to return to being a prostitute that scene nailed it for me and brought theron's performance to an entirely new level the raw emotion theron conveyed carried the movie the performance became more emotional angry vulnerable fearful and edgy and at no point did i think that this was theron acting i saw aileen wuornos the movie itself without charlize theron did not feel to me that it was telling a story that could not have been told on a made for cable because of the content movie but the movie is not so much about the plot and about the story but rather about the performance and transformation of charlize theron into aileen wuornos the performance makes the viewer capable of feeling pity for aileen without excusing her actions i don't feel that there is any question that theron deserved the oscar for monster -joe sherry\n",

      "into this one i was wondering if sam raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus spider-man 2 bluntly the answer is no but listen spider-man 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for spidey 2 was a five star film this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture the special effects are seamless cg venom and the sandman look great while cg spidey continues to astound admittedly i wasn't too impressed with how the goblin looked you really gotta hand it to sam raimi he knows how to handle epic superhero battles in various fabulous faceoffs spidey takes on the goblin the sandman and venom and each time our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor even though we knew spidey was going to come out on top the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter i have absolutely no complaints with the spidey sequences spider-man 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors jk simmons as j jonah jameson hilarious and the sexy elizabeth banks as betty brant more please sam raimi's buddy bruce campbell has a funny bit as a maitre d' mageina tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence stan lee provides the obligatory cameo 'nuff said bryce dallas howard is essentially wasted as gwen stacy and rosemary harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories i say phooey to that i was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character in my opinion the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories by virtue of having been in every film installment harry osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist james franco whom i normally dislike is very good here flint marko aka the sandman thomas haden church is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience early on becomes privy to his core motivation eddie brock a puny and miscast topher grace however is just plain bad egg now there's a chance that newcomers to the spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky wriggly alien symbiote furthermore raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments opting to leave it in residence at peter's cramped apartment to bide its time raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source secret wars anyone hands down spidey's my favorite superhero like a host of kids of the plethora of superheroes it's peter parker with whom i identified the most when i was a mere tadpole what makes him such a rootable underdog character is that stan lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teenyoung man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies this film strays away from what makes him so likable the start of spider-man 3 finds a smug peter parker as spiderman has become the toast of new york his image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers excepting the bugle of course he even is presented with the key to the city this same scene also comes up with an act by peter as spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards mary jane in fact the success of his spider-man persona blinds him to what's going on with mary jane whose career isn't flowing as smoothly understandibly it's not too long before mj begins to feel that peter isn't there for her suffice it to say while i loved every spidey sequence there are moments here where i genuinely did not like peter parker or put another way my dissatisfaction with peter is actually a nod towards kirsten dunst's very effective performance she's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as mary jane that every thoughtless act by peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude i'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk and since i'm crapping on the poor guy i must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool if it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn it failed miserably and the film in my eyes lost some credibility the audience including me burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up unintended laughter - it's not a good thing but i want to reiterate spider-man is my favorite superhero he got me thru junior high school middle school to you youngsters and high school i hated to criticize this movie but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts yet with its flaws spider-man 3 is still very much a sensational movie and i do feel that ultimately its positives outweigh the negatives tobey maguire is the definitive peter parker no matter what i can't really envision anyone else in that role dunst as always is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent the complex story in spite of hitting a few false notes did keep me involved the action scenes are eyepopping nothing at all wrong with them sam raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental low key humor for some reason i like the doorknob bit there's even several brief dance numbers and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse most hopefully will do the former\n",
